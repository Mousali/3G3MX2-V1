# 3G3MX2-V1
OMRON MX2 Series Type V1 Inverter Parameter Generator

## Background

Traditionally, hardware engineers manually deduce settings and parameters based on fundamental principles. This approach demands a profound understanding and experience. To successfully implement even minor changes, an engineer might need to comprehensively read and comprehend the entire Userâ€™s Manual.

A more modern solution involves the use of "expert systems". These platforms capture the intricate relationships between various settings and parameters. Users provide high-level configurations and respond to a sequence of interactive questions. Subsequently, parameters and settings are computed and presented by the expert system.

## Motivation

This project embodies a transformative approach in the domain of hardware engineering. We demonstrate the generation of all parameters for a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) based purely on user system specifications. This is more than just a parameter generator; it's a paradigm shift. By focusing on this method, we aspire to foster a clearer, more automated bridge between system engineering specifications and VFD-specific knowledge. The overarching objective is to streamline processes, minimize errors, and empower engineers to focus on innovative solutions rather than get bogged down by the nitty-gritty details of manual parameter settings.
